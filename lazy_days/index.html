    <h3>by Susan Smith</h3>
    <img src="images/diner.jpg" alt="Diner">
    <p>As my New Year's Resolutions in 2016, I vowed to never again make a meal at home. I found that cooking meals at home took time and effort, and the food never seemed to measure up to the greasy food that is readily available at any old diner.

    <h2> The Art of doing absolutely nothing</h2>
    <h3>by Susan Smith</h3>
    <img src="images/beach.jpg" alt="Beach">
    <p>Is your job taking too much time away from your rest and relaxation? Does your algebra homework keep you up at night? I used to be in the same boat until I quite work and school and devoted myself to doing absolutey nothing. Many people think that laziness is a vice, but I am here to tell you that it is an art.
