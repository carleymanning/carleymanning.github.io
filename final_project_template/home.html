            <h4> Baja is Muy Tranquilo </h4>
    		  	  <img class="Baja" src="img/Baja.jpg" alt="Baja">
    		  	  <p> The following morning was slow going. We all congregated at the restaurant at Rice and Beans for breakfast before agreeing that traveling as a convoy sounded like a great idea. “We’ll follow you guys.” Brian said. And we did. We followed them for days.
               As our mis-matched convoy rolled out of San Ignacio that morning, there was a dense fog that had us all second-guessing where in the world we were. Once we got to higher ground, though, the cool fog lifted and gave way to the bright sun and intense heat. It was brutally hot.</p>
              <p> To Mulege!</p>
              <p> Unfortunately, hurricane Odiel had left this tiny, yet popular, town in a state of disrepair. And it was hot. So we got gas and moved on down the road as fast as we could. It was great! Driving through the desert, dust flying everywhere, not using AC in solidarity of our new friends who don’t have the option.
                  We were “in it”.
                  The road was winding and each turn led us closer to our destination: Bahia Conception. After a long day of driving and sweating and being mildly hung-over, there is absolutely nothing more beautiful than cresting over a pass and seeing the Sea of Cortez, an empty beach, and a palapa.
                  Playa Santispac was, for the day, our new home. We set up our little gypsy camp and ran for the water. It was perfection. Beers flowing just after noon. The grounds keeper, for lack of a better term, was a chipper fellow who had a van full of hats, dresses and hammocks for sale. He also had a boat for rent by the hour, and assured us that Santispac was “muy tranquilo”...</p>

            <h4> Guanajuato </h4>
              <img class="Guanajuato" src="img/GTO.JPG" alt="Guanajuato">
              <p>While planning our trip through Mexico, Guanajuato wasn’t really on our radar. However, after seeing a few pictures of the city, we decided to make a pit stop for a day or two. Guanajuato is considered Mexico’s “Crown Jewel” by most and, once we got there, we could see why.</p>
              <p>The city sits in a narrow valley in the mountains at about 6,600 feet and has a very European feel. The streets are all cobble stone and everything is arranged on steep hills, sprawling out and up from the city center. The town is full of bright colored houses and winding, narrow, walkways and stairways, that lead up to them. Very visually pleasing and romantic.</p>

              <p> We rolled into town, driving through those narrow streets, and set up camp at the “RV Park”. What they call an RV Park is really just some guy’s back yard with a few sketchy electric hook-ups and cold showers. But he was nice and offered us a small discount for the lack of hot water.
                It was early November and, in Mexico, the first night of their Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebrations. So we walked down the incredibly steep hill that the campground sits on top of, to find hundreds of people gathered at the center of town. Everywhere, there were children and adults with face paint, some in full costume. There was live music from mariachis and venders selling “dulces” (sweet treats) in booths that lined the streets. It was enchanting and magical. We couldn’t believe where we were standing...</p>

            <h4> Zipolite </h4>
      	  	  <img class="Zipolite" src="img/zipolite.jpg" alt="Zipolite">
              <p> After spending a couple more days in Oaxaca, we drove south on the long, winding, nausea inducing, road to Playa Zipolite. This beach is by far the best we've been to. A tropical paradise complete with palm trees and thatch roof cabanas lining the beach. We planned to snatch up one of said cabanas, but realized quickly that our plans were foiled: it was the weekend before NYE and the beach was packed! No big, we scored a parking spot in the shade, popped the tent and grabbed a cold cerveza from the bar within spitting distance of our new home. It was clear that we would stay a while. </p>
              <p> Playa Zipolite is a "clothing optional" beach that feels very free and laid back without the hedonistic aspect that one might expect. It's very gay, family, young and old friendly, and very popular with the French hippie crowd. As our new friend Jesus said, "...it doesn't matter what you are. At Zipolite, nobody cares." We met Jesus one afternoon when he, his cousin Angel, and the rest of their crew (a Ska-Punk band/graffiti crew) were catching some shade behind our jeep. They, invited us to hang out and have a couple beers.</p>
              <p> Jesus spoke decent English and was the translator for the night, which was more and more hilarious as the night went on. Brian introduced them to Bourbon, which they did not like, and they invited us to visit them in Mexico City on our way back north. We ended up spending the next couple of nights with them, drinking, laughing and trading stories in broken English and Spanish. </p>
